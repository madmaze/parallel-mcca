\section{Introduction}
% Describes problem & proposed solution
% Their thing runs slowly, and would go a lot faster in parallel. :D

\section{Approach}
% Basic Outline
% Languages: French, German, Spanish
% Data Sources (Copuses, Base Lexicon, Test Words)
% Preprocessing
% Build Vectors
% Run tests

\section{Co-occurrence Counting}
% Explain Cooccurrence and why we need it
% using window size = 3; word order matters

%Context Vectors, using cooccurrence:
The goal is to end up with a set of vectors representing a
corpus. Each vector represents the context that one word (that appeared in the
corpus) appears in. The vector is composed of (word,number) mappings. Each
mapping represents the number of times the word being mapped occurs in a
window around the word the vector is describing. We used a window size of
three, so each word in the vector appeared in the three words before or the
three words after the word being described.

\section{Association Vector}
% take a context vector
% prune to base lexicon
% normalize

\section{Vector Similarity}
% seems almost too simple to get its own section...
% Equation (City Block Distance)

\section{Parallelizing Vector Calculations}

\section{Results}

\section{Conclustions}
Everything is awesome. Especially Tesla.
