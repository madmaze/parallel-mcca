"Wire to New York for a new advance agent. I happen to know of an A1 man
who is out of an engagement. There are two or three others after him,
but I guess I can make it worth his while to go with me. I won't get
left in this way again, you can bet your boots!"

"That's all right," growled Mr. Perley, "but it doesn't help out the
present engagement any."

"No, but we are joint sufferers in that, and we may as well grin and
bear it."

And the irate manager of the New York Comedy Company started for the
telegraph office with fire in his eyes and a look of determination on
his face.

Neither he nor Mr. Perley had observed the presence in the little group
of listeners to their conversation of a rather good-looking,
well-dressed boy of about eighteen.

This lad did not lose a word of the excited discussion, and, as the
manager started to walk away, he muttered:

"This is the chance I have been looking for; I won't let the opportunity
slip. It doesn't seem as if there would be much hope for me, but there's
no harm in trying, anyhow."

He followed Mr. Wattles, and just before that gentleman reached the
telegraph office he tapped him on the shoulder.

The manager turned quickly. When he saw the boy, he asked, impatiently:

"Well, what is it?"

"Can I speak with you a few minutes, sir?"

"Not now, not now."

Mr. Wattles was about to resume his walk, but the boy laid a detaining
hand on his arm.
